My project primarily focuses on a gaming forum where players can engage in discussions and share their perspectives on various aspects of the game, such as gameplay, strategies, or hidden easter eggs. Players can connect with like-minded individuals by adding friends, liking articles, and following each other. Administrators have the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the article game library to maintain order within the forum.
